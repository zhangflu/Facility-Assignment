# Facility-Assignment

**The assignment of algorithm lesson.**

Requiring python3.

`greedy_algorithm.py` is simple greedy algorithm.
`greedy_algorithm2.py` is neighborhood search algorithm.
`genetic_algorithm.py` is genetic algorithm.

There are 71 test instances in folder `Instances`.

Use `python3 genetic_algorithm.py` to run, the result will save in `Result` folder.

I run this algorithm on my computer and put the results in `myResult` folder.
